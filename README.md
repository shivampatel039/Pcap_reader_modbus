# Pcap_reader_modbus
This project takes a Pcap file as input and parses the entire file. It outputs a CSV file with various fields like Source Ip, Destination IP, Source Port,
Destination Port, Pump speed, Water Level. This project focuses on MODBUS traffic and the output CSV file is designed for it.
But this can be modified easily to read Pcap files with different protocol data.
